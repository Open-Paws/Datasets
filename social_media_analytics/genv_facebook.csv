Here are five reasons why:  1. Honey is made by bees for bees Bees store honey in their hive for the cold winter months when there are no flowers in bloom. Honey is their food.  2. Taking honey from beehives kills bees Bees protect their hives with all their might, but humans smoke them out and gas them so that they can steal honey from the hives. This stresses the bees, makes them disoriented, and can even kill them.  3. Bee farms are cruel After taking the honey, farmers replace it with sugar water. This does not provide the nutrients that bees need, and it reduces their immunity, increasing the risk of sickness and death.  4. Bees are sentient Bees can feel joy and pain, they express happiness and sorrow. Studies have shown that they can count, distinguish shapes, and of course they communicate with each other.  5. Making honey is hard work! Bees painstakingly harvest nectar from thousands of flowers to make honey for themselves. It’s estimated that bees have to visit two million flowers to make one pound (450g) of honey!  There are many plant-based alternatives that can be used as sweeteners without hurting the bees.

Esto no puede ser menos cierto.     🌱 El veganismo, además de ser una postura ética frente al sufrimiento sistemático que viven los animales, es la lucha por un sistema alimentario justo, es decir, uno que no destruya paisajes ancestrales, que no contamine los cursos de agua ni arrebate tierras a los pueblos indígenas, que no utilice cantidades desproporcionadas de suelo y agua para que las personas más ricas puedan comer productos de lujo, mientras otres pasan hambre.   😰 La industria ganadera utiliza una gran cantidad de recursos, profundizando las desigualdades sociales características de nuestra era. Si deseamos un mundo más equitativo donde tanto las personas como los animales no sufran, el veganismo es un paso necesario para construirlo.                          💚 ¿Te gustaría saber más sobre los efectos del veganismo?

Pero cada vida tomada es responsable ante Dios.  📜 La Escritura nos insta a valorar a los demás, a hablar por quienes no pueden ser escuchados y a caminar con justicia (Filipenses 2:3, Proverbios 31:8-9, Miqueas 6:8). A la luz de esto, la respuesta se vuelve clara.  🚫 Las granjas industriales y los mataderos no se alinean con los planes de Dios.

En lugar de cultivar plantas para alimentar a 8 mil millones de personas, estamos cultivando comida para 80 mil millones de animales.  🌎 Si combinamos los campos utilizados para el pastoreo con la cantidad de tierra utilizada para los cultivos destinados a la alimentación de los animales de granja, la agricultura animal representa el 77 por ciento de la tierra agrícola global. La carne, los huevos y los lácteos ocupan la mayor parte de la tierra agrícola del mundo pero producen solo el 18 por ciento de las calorías mundiales y el 37 por ciento del total de proteínas.  Un desperdicio tan vasto de alimentos y tierra tiene graves consecuencias tanto para el medio ambiente como para los animales salvajes.  ⚡ ¿Alguna vez has pensado en esto?  #veganismo #soya #soja #plantbased #planeta #medioambiente #mitos #mitosveganos",Jessica Gonzalez Castro,,237,0,237,261,0,261,16.0,6.8,6.1,3,0,3,0,3,,,,,,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=910689407728742&set=a.369597351837953&type=3

La leyenda del Quinto Sol, que describe la creación humana, cuenta que para que nacieran las estrellas y la humanidad, los dioses tuvieron que sacrificarse. El dios Xólotl, hermano gemelo de Quetzalcóatl, debía arrojarse al fuego, pero el miedo lo dominó y decidió escapar. Tomando la forma de animales, se camufló entre los mortales. Después de transformarse en un guajolote, un perro e incluso una planta de maguey, fue capturado. Cansados de perseguirlo y el Xólotl de esconderse, finalmente decidió arrojarse a los lagos de Tenochtitlán y allí se convirtió en un ajolote.  🔬🧫💡 Hoy más que nunca, la especie está en peligro inminente de extinción debido a la contaminación del agua en su hábitat y a la experimentación con animales. El ecólogo Luis Zambrano afirma que la única forma de preservar y estudiar al ajolote salvaje es promoviendo un resurgimiento de las prácticas agrícolas tradicionales y posteriormente designando secciones de los canales agrícolas como santuarios para ajolotes, con la esperanza de facilitar su cruce eventual.

Apesar de parecer um adoçante inofensivo, ele é obtido através de exploração e sofrimento. Confira cinco motivos para não consumi-lo:   🐝 1. O mel das abelhas é das abelhas  As abelhas armazenam o mel na colmeia para se alimentarem durante o inverno, quando há menos flores na natureza.  🐝 2. As abelhas morrem quando tiramos o seu mel  A prática de usar gás ou fumaça dentro da colmeia para extrair o mel é prejudicial para as abelhas. Esse método estressante as desorienta e pode levá-las à morte.  🐝 3. A apicultura é cruel  Os apicultores retiram o mel das colmeias e o substituem por uma solução de água e açúcar. Isso reduz a imunidade das abelhas e aumenta o risco de morte.  🐝 4. Abelhas são sencientes  As abelhas podem sentir alegria e dor, expressar felicidade e tristeza. Estudos comprovaram que as abelhas são capazes de contar, distinguir formas e se comunicar umas com as outras.  🐝 5. Fazer mel é um trabalho duro!  As abelhas trabalham sem parar para coletar néctar de milhares de flores para produzir o seu mel. Estima-se que uma única abelha precisa visitar 2 milhões de flores para produzir 450 gramas de mel!

Mas cada vida tirada é considerada por Deus.  📜 As Escrituras nos incentivam a valorizar os outros, falar por aqueles que não podem ser ouvidos e agir com justiça (Filipenses 2:3, Provérbios 31:8-9, Miquéias 6:8). A partir dessas ideias, a resposta fica clara.  🚫 A pecuária industrial e os matadouros não estão alinhados com os planos de Deus. Como agentes do amor de Deus, devemos reavaliar nossas escolhas e abraçar a compaixão. Portanto, a intenção de Deus é que seres humanos comam animais?

El término «granjas industriales» se usa tan comúnmente en estos días que a veces olvidamos lo que realmente significa: la explotación sistemática de seres vivos a una escala inmensa, sin pensar en ellos más que si fueran componentes de un automóvil que se ensambla en una fábrica.   Pero cada uno de los animales criados, mutilados, golpeados, deliberadamente preñados, muertos de hambre, enjaulados y sacrificados es un individuo, cada uno de ellos con una personalidad distinta, con deseos y necesidades que una granja industrial nunca puede satisfacer.  Cuando las investigaciones revelan el sufrimiento en las granjas, hay un grito comprensible porque la mayoría de la gente es amable y solidaria. Pero para muchos, dejar de financiar la industria ganadera cambiando lo que comen puede ser realmente abrumador.  ⚡️Por eso en GenV hemos creado unos desafíos veganos para ti  ⚡️Puedes registrarte en el siguiente enlace, son gratuitos y fáciles de seguir.  ✊Sé el cambio que quieres ver en el mundo.
