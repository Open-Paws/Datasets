# Reddit CMV Dataset: Pro-Vegan Arguments Analysis

This repository contains a filtered subset of the Reddit Change My View (CMV) dataset. The data focuses on threads where the original post (OP) expressed **anti-vegan** or **anti-animal rights/welfare** views. The dataset is curated to identify and analyze **pro-vegan arguments** that successfully persuaded the OP, as indicated by awarded deltas (Δ).

## Dataset Description

The dataset is stored as a CSV file with the following columns:

- **thread_title**: The title of the Reddit thread.
- **author**: The username of the comment author.
- **delta**: Indicates whether the comment received a delta (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- **text**: The content of the comment.
